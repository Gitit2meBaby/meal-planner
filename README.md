# Meal planner App

using the API from ninjaAPI to fetch recipes this app is designed to take the decision fatigue out of choosing meals and create a shopping list for the user.

Would be nice to sign in and see the recipes for the week and add some calender type environment wherein the user can plan more than a week ahead.

Notifications would be nice, and linking to a Todo App like scenario could be great for the user when they are at the supermarket. Link this back to the app and tick off bought items would be sweet.
